        Today was a hard day. All day I have been procrastinating on homework because of everything going on but right now I am listening to your music and getting through it, doing homework and writing this. I believe I can do anything I want in life as long as I work hard. I will nothing stop me from being happy I am realizing that now. I have been at my lowest lately. I know I got this! I am nervous of writing this. One hour of Wake Me Up on repeat. You are an AMAZING musician! Thank you Avicii!
