    <h1>The background-size Property</h1>

    <h2>background-size: contain:</h2>
    <p>The contain keyword scales the background image to be as large as possible (but both its width and its height must fit inside the content area).</p>
    <div class="div2">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>background-size: cover:</h2>
    <p>The cover keyword scales the background image so that the content area is completely covered by the background image (both its width and height are equal to or exceed the content area). </p>
    <div class="div3">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>No background-size defined:</h2>
    <div class="div4">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    </div>
